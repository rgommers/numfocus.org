Whoohoo!  The Microsoft donation for IPython came in!

Approval of Minutes from Last Meeting


Old Business
============
a.  FSA discussion with Tony Sebro

Limited liability protection is afforded to the projects as well as a greater level of service, while it requires more oversight.

Grantor/grantee model is more of an arm’s length relationship.  Only requirements are that the money is spent in accordance with the 501c3 regulations. But project members are still an unincorporated loose coalition, tax liability is unclear for the projects, etc.

Discussion of concrete example: Microsoft donation to IPython (paid to NumFOCUS).

1) paying developer in France to write tutorials

2) hiring US developer (ex-Cal Poly student) as contractor for a year

Question is if these two things work well under grantor-grantee model, or would it work better as comprehensive sponsor.

2) can be done. IPython writes up a grant, wants NF to allocate money to fund developer. NF contracts with developer. NF responsibility: check developer output is in keeping with the grant. Main thing to be careful for: don’t look like pass-through agent to IRS. Need paper trail showing IPython pitched the idea, NF reviewed it, it’s in the scope of NF, then NF drafted contract with developer. This becomes even more important if you want to fund yourself.

Holding assets becomes more difficult in grantor-grantee model. Who owns IPython trademark? 

Being done now: Julia trademarks possible in future, astronomy library copyright.

Assigning copyright is fine. Filing trademarks is hard if you’re not the entity using/producing the trademarked thing. One individual developer could do it (which is awkward); NF could still pay for it though. Dev can then assign trademark to NF, NF has to draw up a license for it (so project/developers can continue to use it). Solution may be to have a very broad trademark license. Other solution is to license to all leaders of the project. Yet another solution (also for reducing liability of individual devs): project incorporates (but doesn’t file for 501(c)3 status). 

NF also can’t then just give it away under all circumstances - only in the US but not to a foreign org (it’d have to be sold for market value).

Upside of grantor-grantee model compared to comprehensive model: actions of one project cannot affect all other projects under the “umbrella”.

Questions for Tony:

* Q: SWC time effort, practical day-to-day workflow with projects?

   * A: It depends… “Dormant” projects that don’t receive donations, don’t raise money, don’t create liability, require very little time. When projects want to host conferences themselves, that takes a ton of work.  For a grantor-grantee project, it’s much harder to run a conference or any other event that requires signing contracts for a venue, renting space, etc.  Licensing issues can take time too, they require more legal scrutiny. SWC has two full-time staff for 29 projects, the bulk of the time is consumed by ~ ⅓ of those.

* Q: Under grantor/grantee, could NF still offer things like “10 hours of legal support per year, to be used by the project as needed”?

   * A: There are some tricky nuances there: Tony’s retainer is with NF, but the discussions would be with third-parties that are not covered by attorney-client privilege as the projects do not belong to NF.  A relationship would have to be established with the individual projects.  Tony will need to think more about this one.

* Q: Does every single expense need a grant? How would small things like paying for pizza for a meeting, or a night of hotel for a developer work?

   * A: Some things are easy, e.g. a recurring cost for a hosting service.  One-off expenses should be recorded, though it can be relatively simple.

   * Needed for all money distributed: grant request, grant approval and proof (i.e. a receipt) that the money was spent consistent with the request.

* Q: Can the grant application process have “levels” for small/medium/large sizes?

   * A: yes, the IRS just expects standard business practices regarding diligence. Important: there must be a way of linking requests, approvals in board minutes and receipts. The paper trail needs to be easy to track and follow, in case an audit is required. SWC uses the open source Ledger, but it’s a low-level command-line tool, they are looking for a better open source solution. Even proprietary solutions like quicken don’t work very well for non-profit, only quite expensive solutions work well for non-profit work.

* Q: Can NF work as ‘comprehensive’ sponsor for some projects and grantor/grantee for others? Does it raise red flags for the IRS?

   * A: Yes, it can be done. SWC is considering doing that and has talked to other non-profits about that idea.  Fiscal sponsorship is already something that tends to attract heightened IRS scrutiny, this probably won’t add any more to that scrutiny.

* Q: Is there any experience working with academics working for Universities on grantor-grantee model?  Specifically, we would like to avoid the large overhead fees that Universities charge on federal grants.

   * A: For the most part the academic worlds are kept completely separate from the SWC work. Have not had to deal with granting money to University sponsored projects. SWC tries to be part of the process for hiring employees with project to make sure the due diligence is followed, in those instances we probably would not go with an academic.

   * SWC uses ~ $75/hour as their standard rate for contractors, they need to go to the board for anything above that.

* Q: Member project raises money themselves. Is there a mechanism in grantor-grantee model that allows for that money to go to NF?

   * A: Money follows from use of trademark (t-shirts, conference, etc.). NF can be beneficiary of this money, but if trademark is not owned by NF then person raising the money is entitled to keep it.

* Q: You (Tony) saw an ambiguity in current FSA. What needs to change in the FSA in order for it to fit the grantor-grantee model?  

   * A: If you want to go to the grantor-grantee model I suggest you start over. Section 2C of the SWC agreement was taken out, which wouldn’t exist in a grantor-grantee relationship. The grantor-grantee FSA would need to contain:

      * Agreement that NF accepts donations on behalf of project.

      * Agreement that NF allocates that money through grants.

      * Outline the structure under which the project can make grant requests to NF (this is completely missing in SWC agreement, because it’s not needed).

* Q: How difficult is it for a NF to switch types of sponsorship?

   * A: It would be easy to move from a grantor-grantees relationship to comprehensive.  But the major problem with any termination is what happens with the assets.  From gg->comp you keep ownership, from comp->gg you might either have to grant the assets to another 5013c or sell it at market rate.

Tony: We have a threshold question, “Do we want a comprehensive or grantor/grantee model?”
