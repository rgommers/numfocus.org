Old Business
============

Leah incorporated feedback from last meeting and only a few final questions
remain.  Plan to finalize application prior to SciPy and ask a few lawyers to
review.

Aligning the purpose of NumFOCUS on all documentation.

1.  Website:  

- To initiate and support educational programs furthering the use of open
  source software in science - To promote the use of high-level languages and
  open source in science, engineering and math research
- To encourage scientific research
- To provide infrastructure, legal, and organizational support for open-source
  projects for technical computing 

2.   Slide presentation:

The  purpose of NumFOCUS is to promote the use of accessible and reproducible
computing in science and technology.

This is accomplished through:

* Educational programs
* The promotion of high-level languages, reproducible scientific research, and
  open-code development * An increase in collaborative research tools and
  documentation

3.  Certificate of Formation:

- Through research grants, scholarships, project sponsorships, and maintenance
  of open source software, NumFOCUS will promote the development and use of
  high-level, array-based computer languages for improving the practice of
  reproducible science, engineering, and data analytics.

Software Carpentry workshops

* NumFocus “Distribution”.  Idea was raised about creating/distributing
  complete distribution for scientific computing.  Feeling was that this was
  the kind of activity the foundation might financially support, but probably
  wouldn’t be a core activity of the foundation itself.

* Promoting SC workshops through NumFocus was generally supported.  Will be
  added to our educational projects page along with inSCIght.
