Discussion of Fiscal Sponsorship
--------------------------------
Brian Granger visited to discuss the fiscal sponsorship documents.   Brian
wanted to clarify what the services were related to fiscal sponsorship and
ensure that NumFOCUS is clear about what it is providing for the overhead fees.
A healthy discussion ensued which led to the action item of updating our fiscal
document as well as the messaging around that document to clarify the services
provided by NumFOCUS.   In particular issues like tax liability insurance and
any legal help to be provided to the projects was clarified. 

5/29 Minutes approved
---------------------

Items discussed
---------------
Updating Fiscal Sponsorship Document --- Fernando will update fiscal document
to provide overview of services.  We should take care not to over-promise in
the legal document and provide most of the service listing on our website. 

Membership Modifications --- Travis and Leah will update the membership
language based around a new model suggested by Van Lindberg for the PSF and
send around the bylaw amendment for approval.   

Leah will remind Fernando to talk to Josh Greenberg about NumFOCUS during their
conversations next week (Wed and Thurs.)
